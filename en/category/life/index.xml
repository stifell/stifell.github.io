&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-i-spent-the-last-week&#34;&gt;How I spent the last week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beginning of the week turned out to be easy, so on Monday I went in for sports and read a book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday and Wednesday were generally no different, except that I started doing labs on operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday is a hard day. I spent the first two classes at the computer, learning C++. From 15:00 to 19:20 I studied English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday from 12:00 to 14:50 there were couples for computer practice. We have done lab work on Arduino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, I completely rested mentally and physically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How I spent last week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The days from Monday to Thursday were easy, as there were few pairs, but there were a lot of laboratory tests on the OS, so I started doing, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, I spent the first two pairs at the computer, learning C++. From 15:00 to 19:20 I studied English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to IT classes on Saturday, did lab tests on Arduino. After that, I went to a running competition between Moscow universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How I spent last week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The days from Monday to Thursday were easy, as there were not many couples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, I spent the first two pairs at the computer, learning C++. From 15:00 to 19:20 I studied English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t go to couples on Saturday. There were running competitions at the RUDN Stadium. I took 2nd place, congratulate me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday I completely rested mentally and physically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday I went to university for the first two pairs. Asked interesting questions about the laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday is a hard day. I spent the first two pairs at the computer, studying C++. According to the plan, there should be English from 15:00 to 19:20, but there was only an online event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, from 12:00 to 14:50, there were couples on a computer workshop. We did laboratory work on Arduino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, completely mentally and physically rested.&lt;/p&gt;
