John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.\nSyntax Markdown Below are examples of using Markdown, but this is far from a complete guide. A full description of the language can be found on the official website. Characters that are usually treated as special in Markdown can be escaped using a backslash. For example, the sequence “*” will output the character “*”, and will not be a sign of the beginning of the selected text. In addition, Markdown does not convert text inside “raw” XHTML blocks. Thus, you can include XHTML sections in a Markdown document by enclosing them in block-level tags beforehand.\n1. Text with emphasis or logical emphasis\n“* highlighting *”\n“** strong highlighting **”\n2. Program code\nCode elements can be inside a line (inline) or multi-line blocks.\nInside the string, the code is highlighted with the symbol “`” (reverse apostrophe).\n Sample code inside the line (inline) Hello world!  A multiline block of code is indicated by an indent of 4 spaces or one Tab.\nA multi-line block of code begins below\n\u0026lt;!doctype html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Document title --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Document body --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;  The code block has ended\n3. Strikethrough text\nit is necessary to do ~~ one ~~ other thing\n4. Lists\n“*” bulleted list item\n“-” another element of the unnumbered list\n“+” bullet elements can be different\n“1.” Numbered list item\n“2.” Item #2 of the same list\n“9.” Item #3 of the list — the items are numbered in order, the number at the beginning of the line does not matter\n5. Headlines\nTitles are created by placing a grid sign in front of the title text. The number of characters “#” corresponds to the level of the title. HTML provides 6 levels of headers.\n/# The header of the first level\n/### Third level header\n/###### Sixth level header\n The first two header levels also have an alternative syntax:  First level header:\n/========================\nSecond level header:\n/————————\n6. Links\n[Link text](http://example.com / “Optional link header”)\nan alternative way to set links if there are repetitions\nSomewhere among the text there is [link text][example].\nAlso the link repeats [example address][example].\nLink to [second][foo] also [Bar][] resources.\n[example]: http://example.com / “Optional link header” [foo]: http://example.net / ‘Optional link header’ [bar]: http://example.edu / (Optional link header)\n7.

Usually, the main project tree is stored in a local or remote repository, to which access is configured for project participants. When making changes to the project content, the version control system allows you to fix them, combine changes made by different project participants, roll back to any earlier version of the project, if required.\nIn classical version control systems, a centralized model is used, assuming a single repository for storing files. Most version control functions are performed by a special server. The project participant (user) receives the version of files he needs before starting work through certain commands. After making changes, the user places the new version in the repository. At the same time, previous versions are not deleted from the central repository and you can return to them at any time. The server can not to save the full version of the modified files, but to perform a so—called delta compression - to save only changes between successive versions, which reduces the amount of data stored.\nVersion control systems support the ability to track and resolve conflicts that may arise when several people are working on a single file. You can merge (merge) changes made by different participants (automatically or manually), manually select the desired version, cancel the changes altogether or lock files for modification. Depending on the settings, the lock is not allows other users to get a working copy or prevents changing the working copy of the file by means of the OS file system, thus providing privileged access to only one user working with the file.\nVersion control systems can also provide additional, more flexible functionality. For example, they can support working with multiple versions of a single file, keeping a common history of changes up to the point of branching versions and their own change histories of each branch. In addition, it is usually available information about which of the participants, when and what changes were made. Usually this kind of information is stored in the change log, access to which can be restricted. Unlike the classical ones, in distributed version control systems, a central repository is not mandatory.\nAmong the classic VCS, the most famous are CVS, Subversion, and among the distributed ones — Git, Bazaar, Mercurial. The principles of their work are similar, they differ mainly in the syntax of the commands used in the work.\nGit Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.\nGit is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows. The system is designed as a set of programs specially designed for their use in scenarios. This makes it convenient to create specialized version control systems based on Git or user interfaces. For example, Cogito is just such an example of a wrapper to Git repositories, and StGit uses Git to manage a collection of fixes (patches).\nGit supports rapid separation and merging of versions, includes tools for visualization and navigation through the non-linear development history. Like Darcs, BitKeeper, Mercurial, Bazaar and Monotone, Git provides each developer with a local copy of the entire development history, changes are copied from one repository to another.\nRemote access to Git repositories is provided by a git daemon, SSH or HTTP server. The git-daemon TCP service is included in the Git distribution and is, along with SSH, the most common and reliable access method. The HTTP access method, despite a number of restrictions, is very popular in controlled networks, because it allows you to use existing network filter configurations.\n","date":1651708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651708800,"objectID":"dda65146d9fdc613ac6d0ae4ce5f42b3","permalink":"https://example.com/post/git-post/","publishdate":"2022-05-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/git-post/","section":"post","summary":"Article about Version сontrol and Git","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Version control.
